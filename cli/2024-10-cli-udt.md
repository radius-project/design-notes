# CLI commands for User-Defined Types

* **Author**: Reshma Abdul Rahim (reshrahim)

## Topic Summary
<!-- A paragraph or two to summarize the topic area. Just define it in summary form so we all know what it is. -->
User-Defined Types enable Platform engineers to define and deploy their organization's custom services in Radius. More details around the feature, user scenarios and experience can be found [here](/architecture/2024-06-resource-extensibility-feature-spec.md). This document will focus on the CLI experience for UDTs.

### Top level goals
<!-- At the most basic level, what are we trying to accomplish? -->
- Provide an intuitive and seamless experience for platform engineers to create, update, and delete UDTs using the CLI.
- Ensure that the CLI experience is consistent with the other commands in Radius

### Non-goals (out of scope)
<!-- What are we explicitly not trying to accomplish? -->
- Other interfaces and experiences to interact with UDTs are out of scope for this document

## Key scenarios
<!-- List ~3-7 high level scenarios to clarify the value and point to how we will decompose this big area into component capabilities. We may ultimately have more than one level of scenario. -->
The key scenarios for UDTs are outlined [here](/architecture/2024-06-resource-extensibility-feature-spec.md). We will decompose these scenarios specific to the CLI experience.

### Scenario 1: Deb defines and deploys the internal messaging service using the CLI
<!-- One or two sentence summary -->
Deb, a platform engineer who wants to define and deploy their internal messaging service Plaid as a resource type in Radius. 

Before we start designing the experience, we need to understand the high level terminologies/concept that a user would interact with in the CLI experience.

| Terminology | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
|Resource provider | Refers to a group of resource types under a common namespace. Resource providers are also entities that implement the group of resource types | Mycompany.Messaging or Applications.Core |
|Resource type | A service or technology that can be modeled as a resource | PostgreSQL or AWS S3 or Internal messaging service |
|Resource | An instance of a resource type | mydb or mybucket |

#### User Experience

1. Deb uses the rad CLI to scaffold a `yaml` template definition for the internal messaging service `Plaid`

    Option 1:

    ```bash
    rad resource-provider init Mycompany.Messaging --schema-format yaml
    ```
        
    This command will create a folder with the name `Mycompany.Messaging`. A sample `yaml` file is created in the application folder. If we enable typespec, a sample `tsp` will be created and all the required dependencies will be created.

    Pros : Depicts the action of initializing the project with directory structure and dependencies. TypeSpec has similar `init` command to set up the project and would be consistent with that when we support typespec.

    Option 2:

    ```bash
    rad resource-type new Mycompany.Messaging --schema-format yaml
    ```
    
    Deb updates the schema definition with the required fields and properties for the messaging service Plaid. The authoring experience for the resource type will be covered in a separate document.

2. Deb registers the resource type with Radius

    Option 1 

    ```bash
    rad resource-provider create Mycompany.Messaging
    ```
    Pros : Follows the CRUDL convention and is more consistent with the other commands in Radius

    Option 2

    ```bash
    rad resource-provider register Mycompany.Messaging
    ```
    Pros : Consistent with Recipe template registration to environment
    Cons : Does not follow the CRUDL convention

3. Deb creates the resource instance for the messaging service Plaid

    ```bash
    rad resource create Mycompany.Messaging/Plaid -f myplaid.json
    ```
    The resource `myplaid` of type `Mycompany.Messaging/Plaid`is created and available for use.

4. Deb lists the resource providers and resource types available in Radius

    ```bash
    rad resource-provider list
    ```
    The list of resource providers in Radius are displayed.

    ```bash
    rad resource-type list --resource-provider Mycompany.Messaging
    ```
    The list of resource types under the resource provider `Mycompany.Messaging` are displayed.

5. Deb makes changes to the resource type definition of `Plaid` and adds to the resource provider

    Option 1:

    ```bash
    rad resource-provider create Mycompany.Messaging
    ```
    Pros : Same command can be used to update the resource provider with the new or updated resource type definitions

    Option 2 :

    ```bash
    rad resource-type create -f plaid.yaml 
    ```
    Pro : No need to follow a rp directory structure. Resource type gets created/updated to the resource provider. 
    Con : Resource provider is a required input in the `plaid.yaml` schema definition

    Comment: It may be good and complete to support both these options.

6. Deb wants to know the details of resource provider

    ```bash
    rad resource-provider show Mycompany.Messaging
    ```
    The details of the resource provider `Mycompany.Messaging` are displayed.

7. Deb deletes a resource-type Plaid from the resource provider Mycompany.Messaging

    ```bash
    rad resource-type delete Mycompany.Messaging/Plaid
    ```
    The resource type `Plaid` is deleted from the resource provider `Mycompany.Messaging`

8. Deb deletes the resource provider Mycompany.Messaging

    ```bash
    rad resource-provider delete Mycompany.Messaging
    ```
