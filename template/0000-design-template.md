# Title

* Status: Pending/Approved
* Author: Your name (@YourGitHubUserName)

## Overview

<!--
Provide a succinct high-level description of the component or feature and 
where/how it fits in the big picture. The overview should be one to three 
paragraphs long and should be understandable by someone outside Radius
team.
-->

## Terms and definitions

<!--
These terms are internal to your design and will not be shared publicly.
-->

## Objectives

<!--
Describes goals/non-goals and user-scenario of this feature to understand
the end-user goals.
* If the feature shares the same objectives of the existing design, link
  the existing doc rather than repeat the same context.
* If the feature has a scenario, UX, or other product feature design doc,
  link it here and summarize the important parts.
-->

### Goals

<!--
Describes goals to define why we need, where we go, and how we know whether
we will be successful when we deliver this feature.
-->

### Non-Goals

<!--
Describe non-goals to identify something that we won’t be focusing on 
immediately. We won’t be expending any effort on these matters.
-->

### User scenarios (Optional)

<!--
Describe the user scenarios for this design. Ensure that you define the
roles and personas in these user scenarios when it requires API design.
-->

#### User story 1

#### User story 2

## Design

<!--
Provide a high-level description, using diagrams as appropriate, and top-level
explanations to convey the architectural/design overview. Don’t go into a lot
of details yet but provide enough information about the relationship between
these components and other components. Call out or highlight new components
that are not part of this feature (dependencies). This diagram generally
treats the components as black boxes. Provide a pointer to a more detailed
design document, if one exists. If you have the alternatives for your design,
describe alternative solutions too.
-->

### Design details

<!--
This section should be detailed and thorough enough that another developer
could implement your design and provide enough detail to get a high confidence
estimate of the cost to implement the feature but isn’t as detailed as the 
code. Be sure to also consider testability in your design.

For each change, give each "change" in the proposal its own section and
describe it in enough detail that someone else could implement it. Cover
ALL of the important decisions like names. Your goal is to get agreement
to proceed with coding and PRs.

If there are alternatives you are considering please include that in the open
questions section. If the product has a layered architecture, it's good to
align these sections with the product's layers. This will help readers use
their current understanding to understand your ideas.

* Advantages of this design - Describe what's good about this plan relative to
  other options. Does it feel easy to implement? Provide flexibility for
  future work?
* Disadvantages - Describe what's not ideal about this plan. If you don't
  point these things out other people will do it for you. This is a good place
  to cover risks.
-->

### API Design (Optional)

<!--
Include if applicable – any design that changes our public REST API, CLI
arguments/commands, or Go APIs for shared components should provide this
section. Write N/A here if not applicable.
- Describe the REST APIs in detail for new resource types or updates to
  existing resource types. E.g. API Path and Sample request and response.
- Describe new commands in the CLI or changes to existing CLI commands.
- Describe the new or modified Go APIs for any shared components.
-->

## Alternatives Considered

<!--
Describe the alternative designs that were considered or should be considered.
Give a justification for why alternative approaches should be rejected if
possible. 
-->

## Test Plan

<!--
This includes the test plan to validate the features such as unit-test and
functional tests.
-->

## Security (Optional)
<!--
Optional. Use this section to describe a security threat and its mitigation
with this design—such as authenticating request, storing a secret and 
a credential, etc.
-->

## Compatibility (Optional)

<!--
Optional. Describe potential compatibility issues with other components,
such as incompatibility with older CLIs, and include any breaking changes
to behaviors or APIs.
-->

## Monitoring

<!--
This includes the list of instrumentation such as metric, log, and trace to 
diagnose this new feature. It also describes how to troubleshoot this feature
with the instrumentation. 
-->

## Development Plan

<!--
This section is for planning how you will deliver your features. This includes
aligning work items to features, scenarios or requirements, defining what
deliverable will be checked in at each point in the product and estimating the 
cost of each work item. Don’t forget to include the Unit Test and functional 
test in your estimates.
-->

## Open issues

<!--
Describe (Q&A format) the important unknowns or things you're not sure about. 
Use the discussion to answer these with experts after people digest the 
overall design.
-->
