## Introduction

These are prescriptive guidelines that Radius contributors MUST follow while designing APIs to ensure that customers have a great experience. These guidelines help make Radius APIs:
- Developer friendly via consistent patterns

Technology and software is constantly changing and evolving, and as such, this is intended to be a living document. [Open an issue](https://github.com/radius-project/design-notes/issues) to suggest a change or propose a new idea. 

### Prescriptive Guidance
This document offers prescriptive guidance labeled as follows:

:white_check_mark: **DO** adopt this pattern.

:ballot_box_with_check: **YOU SHOULD** adopt this pattern. If not following this advice, you MUST disclose your reason during a design review discussion.

:heavy_check_mark: **YOU MAY** consider this pattern if appropriate to your situation.

:warning: **YOU SHOULD NOT** adopt this pattern. If not following this advice, you MUST disclose your reason during a design review discussion.

:no_entry: **DO NOT** adopt this pattern.

## API Foundation:

Radius provides an HTTP-based API that deploys and manages cloud-native applications as well as on-premise or cloud resources.
The overall design of the Radius API is based on the Azure Resource Manager API (ARM). Radius generalizes the design of ARM, removes proprietary Azure concepts, and extends the ARM contract to support the conventions of other resource managers like Kubernetes or AWS Cloud-Control. 

Radius utilizes TypeSpec for describing API model definitions and operations, providing a consistent approach to defining the structure of API payloads and interactions. The TypeSpec specification serves as the source to generate corresponding OpenAPI 2.0 (swagger) API documentation.

## Guidelines

### Resource Property Design

<a href="#secrets" name="secrets"></a>
### Secrets

<a href="#secret-store" name="secret-store">:white_check_mark:</a> **DO** use [Applications.Core/secretStores](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/resource-schema/core-schema/secretstore/) resource to store sensitive data, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.
When utilizing this resource, Radius ensures that confidential data is handled in a safe and consistent manner across the system.

The TypeSpec definitions include [`SecretReference`](https://github.com/radius-project/radius/blob/ba9195c4bc6ab9be2a83bb1ed6b0f8f357d79812/typespec/Applications.Core/environments.tsp#L193) and [`SecretConfig`](https://github.com/radius-project/radius/blob/ba9195c4bc6ab9be2a83bb1ed6b0f8f357d79812/typespec/Applications.Core/environments.tsp#L126) model types to standardize usage. These are prescribed to ensure sensitive information is handled securely and uniformly across different components and resources in Radius. The following are their definitions along with usage examples:

### SecretReference Model

<a href="#secret-model" name="secret-model">:white_check_mark:</a> **DO** follow this structure when adding support for secrets to resources or components in Radius.

```tsp

@doc("This specifies a reference to a secret. Secrets are encrypted, often have fine-grained access control, auditing and are recommended to be used to hold sensitive data.")
model SecretReference {
  @doc("The ID of an Applications.Core/SecretStore resource containing sensitive data.")
  source: string;

  @doc("The key for the secret in the secret store.")
  key: string;
}

```        

#### Usage of SecretReference

<a href="#secret-envvar" name="secret-envvar">:white_check_mark:</a> **DO** use the `SecretReference` type to reference a single (scalar) secret value in a resource property. Resource properties should reference a `Applications.Core/secretStores` instead of directly containing secret data.

This pattern simplifies the overall design of Radius by reducing the number of places where we store secret data. 
The structure also allows for environment variables to refer to other resources such as `ConfigMaps`, `Pod Fields` etc. in the future. 
Examples include cases where environment variables containing sensitive information are injected into a container or used in a Terraform execution process.

#### Example TypeSpec Definition

```tsp

@doc("environment")
env?: Record<EnvironmentVariable>;

@doc("Environment variables type")
model EnvironmentVariable {

  @doc("The value of the environment variable")
  value?: string;

  @doc("The reference to the variable")
  valueFrom?: EnvironmentVariableReference;
}

@doc("The reference to the variable")
model EnvironmentVariableReference {
  @doc("The secret reference")
  secretRef: SecretReference;
}

```

#### Example Bicep Definition

```bicep

env: {
  DB_USER: { value: 'DB_USER' }
  DB_PASSWORD: {
    valueFrom: {
      secretRef: {
        source: secret.id
        key: 'DB_PASSWORD'
      }
    } 
  }
} 

```

### :no_entry: DO NOT: Store sensitive as clear text in Resource Definitions

Sensitive data MUST NEVER be stored directly in resource definitions or configuration files as clear text. Instead, use references to secrets stored in secret stores.

#### Example of What NOT to Do

```bicep

env: {
  DB_USER: { value: 'DB_USER' }
  DB_PASSWORD:  { value: 'myPlainTextPassword' }  # ❌ This is NOT allowed
} 

```

### SecretConfig Model

<a href="#secretconfig-model" name="secretconfig-model">:white_check_mark:</a> **DO** follow this structure when the stucture of the secret store resource is known and a component or resource in Radius requires authentication to external systems, such as private container registries, TLS certificates.

```tsp

@doc("Secret Configuration used to authenticate to external systems.")
model SecretConfig {
  @doc("The ID of an Applications.Core/secretStores resource containing credential information.")
  secret?: string;
}

```        

#### Usage of SecretConfig

<a href="#secretconfig-ext" name="secretconfig-ext">:white_check_mark:</a> **DO** use the SecretConfig type to reference a structured set of secret values in a resource property. Resource properties should reference a Applications.Core/secretStores instead of directly containing secret data.

This pattern simplifies the overall design of Radius by reducing the number of places where we store secret data.

#### Example TypeSpec Definition

```tsp

@doc("Authentication information used to access private Terraform modules from Git repository sources.")
model GitAuthConfig {
  @doc("Personal Access Token (PAT) configuration used to authenticate to Git platforms.")
  pat?: Record<SecretConfig>;
}

```

#### Example Bicep Definition

```bicep

recipeConfig: {
  ...
  git: {
    pat: {
      'github.com':{
         secret: secret.id
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}

```
